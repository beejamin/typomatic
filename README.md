# TypomaticSass

Typomatic is an all-purpose, pre-cooked Sass typographic kit for your daily needs.

Typomatic uses Compass Vertical Rhythm module and Sass Maps to give a flexible solution for handling type scale on a project.

## Demo
A demo is available, just download the package and open *index.html* file in your favourite browser.

## Config
The *_config.scss* file holds the Sass Maps with the type scale and type weight values. Use it to modify the scale to match your project.

## Mixins
### type-scale
The scale is defined in the *$type-scale* Sass Map type sizes defined in the *_config.scss* file.

Mixin arguments:

    $scale

The scale argument takes a value from the list of sizes (small, base, medium...) defined in the *$type-scale* map.

    $map

The map argument takes a map defined in the *$type-scale* map, usefull if you have two different typefaces with different styles.


### type-weight
The weights are defined in the *$type-weight* Sass Map type sizes defined in the *_config.scss* file.

Arguments:

    $weight

The weight argument takes a value from the list of weights (light, regular, bold...) defined in the *$type-weight* map.
